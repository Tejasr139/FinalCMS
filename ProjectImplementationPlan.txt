It seems like you want to develop a website with the following pages:

Home
About Us
Our Services
Portfolio
Gallery
Contact Us
And you want these pages to be managed from an admin panel. This means that the content of these pages should be dynamic and editable from the admin panel.

The theme of this project is a Content Management System (CMS). A CMS is a software application that allows users to create, edit, and manage content on a website without requiring technical knowledge of web development.

In this case, the admin panel will serve as the CMS, allowing administrators to:

Create, edit, and delete content on the website
Manage the layout and design of the website
Configure settings and options for the website
The admin panel will provide a user-friendly interface for administrators to manage the website's content, without requiring them to write code or have technical expertise.

Here's a high-level overview of how the admin panel might work:

Login: Administrators log in to the admin panel using a username and password.
Dashboard: The admin panel displays a dashboard with links to manage different sections of the website.
Page Management: Administrators can create, edit, and delete pages, including the ones listed above (Home, About Us, etc.).
Content Editor: Administrators can edit the content of each page using a WYSIWYG editor (What You See Is What You Get) or a Markdown editor.
Media Management: Administrators can upload and manage images, videos, and other media files used on the website.
Form Management: Administrators can configure the Contact Us form, including the fields and email settings.
Settings: Administrators can configure website settings, such as the website title, logo, and contact information.
When an administrator makes changes to the content or settings, the changes will be reflected on the live website.

The Contact Us page will have a form with the following fields:

Name
Email Address
Mobile Number
Subject
Details
When a user submits the form, the system will send an email to the administrator with the user's details, and also send a confirmation email to the user.

The admin panel will provide a way for administrators to view and manage the form submissions, including the ability to respond to inquiries and track communication with users.
